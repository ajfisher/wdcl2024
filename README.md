# Follow me! I know what I'm doing... (I think?)

This was a talk I gave at Web Directions Code Leaders 2024.

## Synopsis

You lead a team. In your business, you're an acknowledged expert in your domain.
You're kicking goals. You've got this.

Then, suddenly, the leader of your wider function departs. Now, it’s your job
to step into their shoes. Overnight, your team has quadrupled in size. You find
yourself at the helm of an extensive hierarchy, with direct reports who
themselves have direct reports, and so on. You’ve transitioned from a practice
manager to an enterprise leader. Colleagues across the business expect you to
have all the answers. Also, you're now responsible for a significant chunk of
the company's sales — 10%, to be precise.

At the team's all-hands meeting, all eyes are on you, waiting for words of
wisdom. Are you ready?

I wasn’t. Despite over a decade of leadership experience, I found myself
unprepared for such a drastic change. My aim in this talk is to prepare you for
what might be the most significant career transition you’ll ever face: moving
from expertise leader to general management.
