# Follow me! I know what I'm doing... (I think?)

Code Leaders, 2024
Andrew Fisher

Notes:

Good morning.

Before beginning I would like to pay my respects to Elders past and present of
the Wiradjuri People, on who's land we gather today and to which sovereignty
was never ceded.

It is an absolute pleasure to be here today.

As Craig mentioned, my name is Andrew Fisher and I'm really excited to be
talking to all of you about stepping up into more senior leadership roles for
the next 30 minutes.

* Reports who are ICs <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-out" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* 2 layers of reports <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-out" data-fragment-index="2" -->
* 3 layers of reports <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-out" data-fragment-index="3" -->


Notes:

We're all leaders here, and maybe a few soon to be leaders as well. So I want
to get a quick sense of where everyone is on their leadership journey. A quick
show of hands.

Who has reports that are individual contibutors?

Okay what about people who have 2 layers of reports?

Anyone have bigger teams, maybe with 3 or more layers reporting into you?

Okay, so we're mostly leaders who have ICs reporting into us.

Now I want you to close your eyes...

Background image 1 is a small team huddle

Notes:

Imagine, right now you're standing in front of your team. But,

---

background image 2 is a seriously large team someone at the front.

Notes:

I want you to
imagine that team two levels up from where you report right now. You haven't
had much warning and you're now also leading teams that aren't part of your
direct experience. Maybe you're looking after design or marketing for example.

Everyone is looking at you.

They are expecting you to give them the direction and priorities for the next
quarter and your vision for where the team and the org is headed.

Do you know what you'd say? 

Is anyone's heart rate ticking up a little even thinking about that prospect?

There's probably a few of you in here thinking, "Yes! Finally I have the power
to change all of the things that are wrong in this place!".

Some of you might be thinking, "There's no way you can pay me enough to do that
job."

Wherever you fall, if you're serious about leadership as part of your career -
and I think all of you are by being here today - there will come a point where
your experience as a tech leader will be less valuable than your more general
management skills.

---

steep learning curve or something... gaps in capability

Notes:

I got an opportunity to take that step several years ago and honestly, even with
extensive leadership experience for more than a decade, I wasn't prepared.

The gaps quickly became apparent. This was going to be a steep learning curve
and, in retrospect, it was the most difficult role transition I've had since
becoming a tech lead originally.

Today, I want to talk to you about some of the gaps you're likely to have,
coming out of practice leadership but give you some of the areas you can start
to develop, regardless of what stage you are in your career. The great news is
that management and leadership are skills, like any other - so you can develop
them if you work on them.

---

### Agenda

1. Business strategy and drivers
2. Communications and relationships
3. People and Team Design

Notes:

Today we're going to focus on these three areas:

1. Developing an understanding of the business strategy and organisational drivers.

2. Look at ways to communicate as a leader and how to build relationships to
supercharge your impact. And;

3. Give you some ways to think about your people, and team design.

So with that - let's dive in.

---

## Strategy and Drivers

* Understanding strategy.
* Organisational drives.
* Customer understanding.

Notes:

We're going to start by looking at the strategy and drivers for the organisation.

Here, we're going to focus on a couple of key areas:

* Understanding our strategy
* What drives the organisation
* Knowing your customers

I'm not going to touch on the real mechanical stuff like building a horizon plan
or a business investment case or risk management etc. This is all pretty important,
but there are heaps of good examples out there for this. I suspect some of you
are probably feeding into or buiding these already.

---

### Understanding Strategy

Notes:

Let start at the top.

When a business has a clear, well articulated strategy, everything just flows
outwards from that. When everyone is aligned to it, the organisation becomes effortless.

At its heart, strategy is as much about what you are
NOT doing as much as what you are.

---

Diverging lines, compounding error

Notes:

However, if your strategy is not clear, or well understood, then everything
that follows will be out of alignment and compound in terms of error.

So for you, as a leader, one of your main jobs is to be very clear about the
immediate and wider goals. You want to start getting comfortable with asking
questions - especially around being clear about what problem the team is solving
for.


---

More why and less what...

Notes:

Putting that into practice - in your next planning meeting ask lots of questions
that are less about the "what" and focus in on the "why" as well as "how" what
you're planning is joining up to the organisational strategy. This will help
you uncover the intent and anchor your approach for impacting strategy.

---

## Drivers

Notes:

Now, alongside our business strategy which sets out our goals, are the business
drivers. Business drivers come down mostly to what are the main ways the org
makes or spends money.

---

# Money In minus Money out = Profit


Notes:

It really is as simple as this:

Where the complexity comes in, is how you go about doing that in your particular
organisation. But if you can understand how the core business functions, then
you can start to understand where you can focus to drive impact.

---

# things

* 10% Sales from online (grow sales, don't sacrafice)
* 90% Sales from physical stores (optimise all sales)

Notes:

For example, if I'm a retailer and 10% of my sales come from online and the rest
from physical stores, there's a couple of drivers I can consider to determine
activities that would create biggest impact.

If I grow online whout sacraficing any physical store sales, I've just added
to top line revenue. I've improved my money in. 

If, however I can optimise something in my physical stores that touches every
sale, I can make 90% of my sales more efficient. So I've affected my money out.

But, if I optimise something in my online channel, the best I can impact is
10% of my total revenue. That might be more questionable in terms of impact.


---

Thinking face? (is this worth it...)

Notes:

When you understand how your business works, you can quickly determine whether
a strategy you're considering is a good idea or not to pursue.

An organisation I worked with did some great work identifying a new service that
in 3-5 years would make about $10-15M. Great outcome yes?

No.

This business was making $750M a year already and growing. This hugely complex
and very disruptive project which the business had little expertise in was going
to impact revenue by about 2%. It wasn't worth it.

Thankfully, we realised and stopped before going too far.

So, understanding how our strategy and drivers interact, helps us understand
the scale of the impact we can have.

---

### Know your customers

Notes:

Alongside our strategy and our drivers, we then have our customers.

Hands up. Who has had a direct interaction with one of your end customers during
the month of June? Hands down if you're a consultant?

As a leader, you need to know your customers first hand. You need to listen to
them and walk in their shoes. 

---

Intelligence

Notes:

Building this understanding means you're able to bring first hand intelligence
back to your team. It means you can validate approaches for things you are
planning and see the impact of the initiatives you're doing.

If you haven't before, go ask your customer or marketing teams for their
customer reports. It's too easy for us to sit in HQ and not iteract directly.

But, if you talk to your customers, you start to appreciate the organisation's
drivers in action and see how your strategy is working.

---

### Todo:

1. Organise a skip level meeting upwards to understand strategy more.

2. Get details about your business drivers from finance.

3. Get out in the field and talk to customers.

Notes:

Regardless of where you are in your career, here are some thing you can do
right now to practice this:

1. Really understand your organisational strategy. Organise a 1 on 1, 2 levels
up from where you report to find out more.

2. Be curious about the drivers of your business. Go talk to your finance team
or channel leaders and really deep dive into this.

3. Discover your customer. Next week, I want you all in the field having
conversations with your direct customers.

Now we've talked about strategy and drivers, we're going to turn our attention
to how to be more effective as a leader and think about communications and
relationships to maximise our impact.

---

## Communications and Relationships

Notes:

All of you will have seen how much impact both good and bad comms can have.

Who here has ever said something to your team that was a bit loose and it's
been totally misunderstood as to your intent? Yep - we've all done it at some
point.

When you get it right, good communications can have a wide and lasting impact
across your team and org.

But, alongside good comms, we also need to build relationships. 

Creating good relationships allows you to create impact across a much wider
span in your organisation.

---

## Communications and Relationships

1. Being effective in our comms

2. Building relationships intentionally

Notes: 

The great thing is, developing both of these skills requires no particular
authority or seniority to work on them practically. And the only permission you
need is from yourself.

Here we're going to touch on both of these ideas:

* Being effective in our communications
* Building relationships intentionally.

Lets talk about communications first.

---

### Communications

Notes:

Obviously, foremost we want to be striving for clarity so we can get our message
across.

With a good team, your goal is to give them as much great information as possible
so they can get on and do what's needed. You also need to be effective in helping
reach decisions.

There's a copule of techniques I find help with this.

The first is focussed on asking lots of questions. Don't assume you know everything,
or that you have to be perceieved to hold all the answers. So don't hold back,
even if the question seems stupid or obvious. Often, as a leader, you CAN be
the person who asks the unaskable and you give permission to others to do the same.

---

Decisions

Notes:

The other technique is when you're working on solutions or providing perspectives
in a group. You need to be mindful about your voice carrying more weight than
others as you get more senior implicitly.

To balance this, make sure you are the last person to state your thoughts. You can be
direct about that, "I want to hear all of you first", or just steer the conversation
that way. This will give you more diverse perspectives which may inform your
position further but additionally, it will also mean you don't tip the scales
towards your opinion and have some of the group just agree with you.

Remember, your job isn't necessarily to have the answer - it's to facilitate
getting to that answer and often, be the one who takes accountability for the
decision you all arrive at.

---

### Relationships

Notes:

Now let's turn our attention to a skill I think is a super power in many orgs
which are relationships.

Great leaders build a vast network of relationships across all levels and
functions of the organisation.

---

Intelligence gathering

Notes:

To start, this gives you valuable intelligence:

What are the pain points that team has? Maybe we can help.
How is that project going? Their delay might impact our initiative.
Etc.

Mostly, this is about listening and asking questions of people in the org.

But once you have a wide set of relationships you can also facilitate connections.

---

Connections

Notes:

For example, if you're having a convesation with Alex and they have talked about
a pain point they are experiencing but you know Jo had to deal with something
similar, you can bring them together to collaborate to a shared objective.

Now, how do we do this intentionally?

---

Relationship map.

Notes:

One way is simply build a relationship map. If you're in a product squad you
have probably seen one of these already. It's pretty much the same but for you.

What you're trying to do is understand who you should be spending time with across
your org to understand what is going on? Who do you need to spend time with
to get things done or unblock things? And who do you know is going to need time
so you can bring them on the journey for your projects as you're delivering.

As you do this, don't forget externals.

Make sure you include partners, key customes or other parties in this map as well.

With your map in hand, it's then just about spending time with these people to
engage and listen to them.

When you get a new role, this is really easy - you just reach out to all of your
predecessors contacts and ask to caht to them about how your team is doing, what's
good and bad etc. But even without doing that you can just reach out to people.

It's a bit daunting to start, it's like asking someone on a date. But people
like it when you show a genuine interest to understand their area and how
you might work better together.

---

### Todo

1. Build a relationship map

2. Start a new relationship in your org

Notes:

So your homework, is to start building out your relationshhip map and by the end
of today, I want all of you to dash off a note to schedule time with someone
in your org you don't know very well.

So now we've talked about effectiveness in our comms and building relationships,
let's turn our attention to people and team design.

---

## People and team design

* What capabilities do we need
* Immediate team structure
* Ways of working

Notes:

As you lead bigger, and more multidisciplinary teams, success lies in the
agency of others.

At whatever level you are operating at though, as a leader you generally get the
opportunity to determine your people and the ways your team work together.

To that end, we're going to look at:

* Defining what our team needs to be good at
* Designing the structure of our immediate team
* Working together as one

---

### Team capabilities

Notes:

Let's start by thinking about the makeup of your team and specifically your
immediate reports.

It goes without saying that this team should be as diverse as you can make it to
get the best mix of viewpoints and drive better outcomes. That's a whole other talk
that others will cover off today.

For your team, the things you want to think about are what do YOU do in the team
and what are *your* capabilities? And, what are each of your *reports* doing
and what are *their* capabilities?

This sounds obvious right? But I see teams not be clear about this and so they
aren't then clear about who is doing what.

---

Team capability model

Notes:

The way I think about this is by using a capability model.

I start by breaking down all of the key capabilities the team needs to be good
at to be successful against our mission.

Once you have this, you need to overlay the areas that you are good at and just
as importantly what you are bad at to help drive the structure.

---

### Team structure

Bad at capabilities overlay

Notes:

We'll start with the "what are you bad at" items and focus on that first.

The way to address your gaps is by using the expertise of your directs to fill it.

The person to fill this main gap should be someone that has extensive credibility
in the capability and should also be senior enough to be obviously your second
in command for the team.

Your goal with this relationship is for it to be a collaboration that is greater
than the individual parts.

You need to delegate to this person, empower them and set them up to be the go
to expert in their domain. This is a role that can help scale your team's
communications and influence outcomes because now the two of you can be in
different places at the same time with a cohesive message.

---

Top area overlay

Notes:

So you've modelled your function, identified your weaknesses and can fill against
them, now I want you to think about which area are you most strong at?

Whatever that is, you need a capable person to step in and you need to step
away. Completely step away.

How many times have you seen a leader spending too much time in the area they
know really well and being disruptive, whilst the others go begging.

Don't be a meddler in your team. 

AS you know this area well, you also know what great looks like. So you should
be able to identity a fantastic candidate for this role, who can do it at least
as well as you can.

This is also an area of your portfolio you want to delegate entirely. Step out
and have a great person look after it. 

---

Other roles overlay

Notes:

Now, the other roles in your portfolio is where you can mix it up a bit. This is
where you can give people opportunities to step up, bring in a junior person or
give someone the opportunity to X-skill.

This is where the capability model helps because you can be clear about what the
needs are and what is the best way to fill them.

These roles are where you can spend a bit more time as a leader, growing the
capability of the team, knowing other areas will be dealt with strongly. Here you
can support on strategy or delivery as well as coaching and mentoring those
team members. You should encourage your other heavy hitters to be doing peer
based leadership and mentoring as well.

---

### Ways of working

Notes:

Once you have your team and how the structure will work, you should think about
how you're all going to work together. This isn't about tools like whether we
use Jira or Trello or Slack or Teams. This is more about how are we going to
share information and who has authortity in different scenarios.

If you're clear about this stuff as a team it means no one is dancing around
afraid to step on each others toes. It also means your team are well informed
and helps empower them to just get on and get things done - knowing they have
backup.

Your roles as the leader in this is to facilitate the discussionand get to the
outcome rather than set out your thoughts about who does what and how.

This process can also help surface and assumptions about implied responsibilities
as well so that all comes out on the table too.

---

Social contract / canvas etc

Notes:

Many squads have a form of this using a team canvas or social contract. Use
whatever works for you and your team or what you're familiar with. 

The key is to be having the discussion as a team and being clear about how you
want to work together and who is doing what.

---

### Todo

1. Build a capability model for your team

2. Organise a ways of working session

Notes:

So the obvious things to do here are to build out your capability model and
have a session together working on this stuff as a team.

Now we've considered how our team is organised and how we work together, lets
bring this all home and give you some more things to do and some resources.

---

## Outro

Notes:

As I wrap up, I want to leave you with a few things you can do right now.

Besides the other things I gave you as homework, I want you to start thinking
about some of these things:

---

### Training

* Formal courses (eg Uni, AIM)
* Orgnisational leadership or management training?
* Subsidised costs

Notes:

1. Training

* are there courses that are appropriate for you to go on?
* Does my business offer leadership or management training?
* Can I get some training subsidised by work or other programs?

---

### Getting a mentor

* Who are leaders you admire in your org?
* External leaders you know of
* Reaching out

Notes:

2. Get yourself a mentor

* Do you know someone in the organisation who you think is a great leader and
you relate to their style or background?
* Are there people externally who might be a good fit for you?
* With mentoring, just reach out to people. Worst case someone says no, but
is really flattered that you asked. Best case you get a mentor!

---

### Developing through practice

* Start practicing today
* Start small, iterate and learn

Notes:

3. Developing your skills:

* No matter what level you're at, you can put many of the things I've talked
about today into practice right now.
* Start trying things out with your team and start developing some of these
skills and get the learning in before you need it.

---

* Understanding strategy and drivers
* Communications and relationship building
* People and team design

Notes:

We've covered a lot of ground today. We talked about the importance of understanding
the strategy and drivers of your organisation. We then went into being
effective in our communications and how to build relationships intentionally.
Finally, we touched on setting your people up the right way.

---

something in there

Notes:

Being a leader is hard - but it is a privilege.

When you create an impact on a large scale, create great outcomes for your org
and your customers it is incredibly rewarding.

I'm probably biased, however given technology and digital permeate every part
of the customer experience and enables all aspects of the organisation I think
as technology leaders we have a great deal to offer organisations in senior
leadership roles. 

And, we're starting to see those roles appear and begin to get those opportunities
in non-tech businesses.

So it's time to get ready for them. Your career ceiling is no longer CTO or CIO - it's
wherever you want to take it in the org.

>>>> I wasn't really prepared for my step up out of practice leadership and into
a wider role and I had to learn fast. Fortunately, I was surrounded by a great
number of people who were truly vested in my success and supported me.

The earlier you start on this journey, the easier it will be to develop these
skills and bring them to bear when you need them.
